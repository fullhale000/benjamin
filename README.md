# Lightbulb Lab

### Program the two buttons to be able to turn the light "on" and "off" by switching the pictures and changing the background color of the box.


Using this Starter Repository and Repl.it (if possible) edit the main.js file to allow for the following:

* When the user clicks on the ON button
  * the image will change sources to the "on.png" image.
  * the background of the division that holds the image will change to the color #FFFFFF
* When the user clicks on the OFF button
  * the image will change sources to the "off.png" image.
  * the background of the division that holds the image will change to the color #1C1C1C

You will need to add any additional functions and variables to make your program work.
Just like our other programs when you use a variable to grab an HTML input you can use it's value property, with images you can change or set it's src property
```javascript
image.src = 'cat.png'
```
To change the background color you update the style property of the element
```javascript
output.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
```
Be sure to commit you changes in Repl.it to submit your work
